The list of the submitted files:

#slist.c- This file include implementation of the methods from the header file, 
	  and one private method - called createNode, this function create node and insrert his values, 
	  Used in the functions: slist_append and slist_prepend).

	and some of private method:
	1.the function - printMatch: print the values of the match. 
	2.the function - freeState: free one state.
	3.the function - destroyRecursion: destroy the fsm recursively and call to freeState function.
	4.the function - initState: insrert desirable values to the state.
	5.the function - initEdge: allocation memory for edge and put valus in it.
